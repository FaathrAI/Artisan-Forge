ArtisanForge: The AI-Powered Creative Studio for NFT
& Digital Art

Vision: To empower digital artists with an intuitive, AI-driven platform that transcends simple
layer-based generation, enabling unprecedented creative control, artistic exploration, and
streamlined NFT creation, from concept to collection.
Core Philosophy: ArtisanForge isn't just an "NFT generator"; it's an AI-powered co-creator. It
allows artists to collaborate with intelligent algorithms to produce unique, high-quality art while
retaining their distinct artistic voice.

Features  "Concept-to-Canvas" AI Generative Engine (Beyond Layers):
â—‹ Text-to-Art & Image-to-Art (Foundation Models): Users can start with text
prompts (e.g., "cyberpunk samurai in a neon city, rainy night") or upload initial
sketches/images. The AI will generate a diverse range of artistic interpretations
based on the input, acting as a dynamic starting point, rather than just combining
pre-existing layers.
